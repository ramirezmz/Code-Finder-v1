# CODE FINDER

This project arose from a problem that I had and friends from work at the company I worked for in 2021.

We had a list of approximately 15670 ites which have code... which we need to make a **Purchase Request**

So, every time we wanted an item, we needed to open Excel, and look for similar keywords and/or codes, as it has various types of gloves, cars, screws and more.

So I decided to put my knowledge in programming into practice to make it more pleasant to look for, with a simple interface and aimed at quickly getting what I wanted, the blessed code!!

## I needed to know about ...

- Reactjs
- Hooks ( useStates )
- Manipulation JSON


## This is de beginning

Yes, I think to improve my skills and bring better versions of the project.
If anyone wants to give tips, a light on how to improve, I'll be happy to receive
